# LocalizedSchemas

An experiment on using localized schemas - that is, schemas that only include fields for a given locale.

The idea is to fetch less data from the DB when all fields are included in the schema, but only a few (from a given locale) are being used.

## Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
